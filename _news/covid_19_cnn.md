I am pleased to announce that our newest research article on COVID-19, **Interpretable artificial intelligence framework for COVID‑19 screening on chest X‑rays**, has been published on the 27th of May 2020.

We developed an *Interpretable Deep Learning* model for COVID-19 screening. Its performance surpasses the *state-of-the-art* at predicting *COVID-19* against common pneumonia cases, while at the same time it provides meaningful and interpretable insight for the clinicians (Figure 1).
