abstract="The successful application and reported robustness of Mutual Information
both in rigid and nonrigid image registration over the last decades gave
rise to an ongoing research on other information based similarity metrics
emanating from Renyi Divergence. To the best of our knowledge however, this
is the first paper studying the effects of Renyi parameter in combination
with a subsampling factor in image registration accuracy. To this end, a
series of experiments are presented with respect to the effect of Renyi's
parameter and the subsampling factor in registration accuracy. Our results
show that the increase of the Renyi parameter and the percentage of the
pixels used leads, on average, to the reduction of the registration error."
