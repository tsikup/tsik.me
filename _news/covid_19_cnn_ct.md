#### Advancing Covid‑19 differentiation with a robust preprocessing and integration of multi‑institutional open‑repository computer tomography datasets for deep learning analysis

<hr>

I am pleased to announce that our second research article on COVID-19, [Advancing Covid‑19 differentiation with a robust preprocessing and integration of multi‑institutional open‑repository computer tomography datasets for deep learning analysis](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2020.9210), has been published.

In this paper, we developed a *Deep Learning* pipeline for COVID-19 screening from CT images. Firstly, a *state‑of‑the‑art* custom U‑Net model is applied to the CT image, in order to properly segment the lung areas. The segmentation model achieves a *DICE* similarity coefficient performance of *99.6%*. Secondly, a classification network, which is based on a pre-trained VGG-19 model, is applied on the segmented images for COVID‑19 versus pneumonia differentiation and exhibits an area under curve  (*AUC*) of *96.1%*.
